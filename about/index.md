## Work Experience

As a member of the Fonville Morisey Lochmere team, I focus on combining knowledge of local real estate markets and trends with a highly customer-centric attitude to make my clientâ€™s experience with buying, selling, or renting a home the most valuable experience possible.

### Student Assistant

As a member of the Student Assistant team at Appalachian State library, my primary assignment was at the front desk maintaining best circulation practices, troubleshooting any challenges patrons may have, and assisting with student research.
