I've been looking into development trends in Raleigh lately using [open data.](https://data.raleighnc.gov/)  Here's a historical look at building permits over the past seven years using [Plotly](https://plot.ly/~kiefersmith/4/building-permits-issued-in-raleigh-from-2009-to-2016/).  What trends do you see?

In my development environment the graph was stacked bars (far easier on the eyes), but when I uploaded it to the hosting site the bars ended up side-by-side.  Also, I could probably have incorporated some sort of sorting algorithm to make the bars look nicer.

Have suggestions for a visualization?  Leave a comment!
