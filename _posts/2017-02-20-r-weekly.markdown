During my Monday morning ritual of avoiding work,  I found [this publication](https://rweekly.org/) that is written in R, for people who use R - R Weekly.  The authors do a pretty awesome job of aggregating useful, entertaining, and informative content about what's happening surrounding our favorite programming language.  Check it out, [give the authors some love on GitHub,](https://github.com/rweekly) and leave a like if you find something useful there.

Have a good week,

Kiefer Smith
