Over the past ten years, Raleigh and the outlying areas have been growing at a breakneck pace.  The availability of jobs and the awesome local amenities have made the Oak City one of the most desirable places in the country to live.  Where are all these people living?  Some of them get lucky in the hot resale market, but many are choosing to build new.  In this graph, I used data from [Raleigh Open Data](https://data.raleighnc.gov/) and [plot_ly](https://plot.ly/) in R to display the builders who completed the most new builds in 2016.  Click the picture for an interactive version!
